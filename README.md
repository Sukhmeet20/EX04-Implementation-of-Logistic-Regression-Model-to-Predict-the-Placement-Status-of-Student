# EX 4 Implementation of Logistic Regression Model to Predict the Placement Status of Student
## DATE:

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Model to Predict the Placement Status of Student.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm

1. Load the dataset and perform any necessary preprocessing, such as handling missing values
and encoding categorical variables.
2. Initialize the logistic regression model and train it using the training data.
3. Use the trained model to predict the placement status for the test set.
4. Evaluate the model using accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Program:
